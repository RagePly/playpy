# Python Playground

Just some small and possibly obscure scripts I've written

## Scripts

- [fun.py](./fun.py): Higher order functions and playing around with combinators. Trying to make it read like Haskell.
- Calculator: Extremely simple calculator that isn't just `import math,sys; print(eval(sys.stdin.read()))`
  - [tok.py](./tok.py): Tokenizer, cheating with regular expressions. Somewhat useful.
  - [yard.py](./yard.py): Shunting-Yard algorithm implementation.
  - [pol.py](./pol.py): Stack machine, parsing reverse polish notation.
